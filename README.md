# Quizzie

Quizzie is an angular gaming platform for quizzes and trivia games.

It allows the user to play a quiz full of random questions or play a custom quiz, created by another user.

After each quiz is completed, points are added to the user's profile.

Quizzie also has a Forum, the so called "Creator's Hub". In the forum users can share ideas and good practices about creating quizzes.

Quizzie has the following main routes:

- ```/user```

- ```/quiz```

- ```/forum```

**Unlogged** users can only play random quizzes and read posts in the forum. Once **registered**, a user gains access to all of Quizzie's functionality.

Users can also send messages to Quizzie's team via the contact form in the footer.
